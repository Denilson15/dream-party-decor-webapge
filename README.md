# Dream Party Decor Contact Page

This is a personalized contact page for **Dream Party Decor**, built on top of a baseline design originally provided by Scrimba.

## ✨ Overview

The site features a clean, mobile and desktop friendly design with a contact form for users to submit their event details, including:
- Name
- Email
- Phone Number
- Event Date

A thank-you message will eventually be displayed upon submission.

## 🛠️ Personalization

While the original layout and styling were provided by Scrimba, the following changes were made:
- Updated branding, colors, and logo to reflect **Dream Party Decor**
- Modified copy/text to match business tone and purpose
- Adjusted form fields for relevant event contact details

## 🚧 Functionality (To Be Added)

- JavaScript will be added to:
  - Capture and log form data
  - Display a thank-you confirmation message
  - Potentially integrate with a backend or service to store submissions

## 📸 Before Customization

The original Scrimba template featured a form for uploading images to create custom avatars. The design has since been repurposed for event-based contact collection.

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – main structure of the contact form
- `style.css` – styling for the layout
- `script.js` (planned) – for handling form submissions

Stay tuned for updates as functionality gets added!
